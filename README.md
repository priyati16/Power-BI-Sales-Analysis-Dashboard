# Power BI Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on end-to-end sales data analysis using Power BI to derive meaningful business insights related to revenue, customer behavior, product performance, and regional trends. The dashboard helps stakeholders monitor key metrics and make data-driven decisions through interactive visualizations.

## Business Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze overall sales performance, track growth trends, identify top-performing products and regions, and understand customer demographics to support strategic business planning.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes sales transaction records, customer demographic details such as age, gender, income, and occupation, product and category information, and country-level geographic data. The data used is public or anonymized, and no confidential business information is shared.

### Key KPIs
Total Sales: 26.52M
Last Month Sales Growth: 2.8%
Total Products Sold: 158
Customer Footfall: 17.89K

### Key Insights
The analysis shows that the business generated total sales of 26.52 million, reflecting strong overall revenue performance. Month-over-month sales increased by 2.8 percent, indicating positive recent growth. Europe and North America emerged as the highest revenue-generating regions, while other regions show potential for expansion. Sales peaked during 2020 and 2021, followed by a decline in 2022, suggesting the need for deeper trend analysis and forecasting. Gender-wise sales contribution is nearly equal, indicating balanced customer engagement across male and female customers. The top seven products, mainly from the Mountain and Road categories, account for a significant portion of total revenue. Customers belonging to professional and management occupations with higher income levels tend to generate higher sales and frequent repeat visits.

## Dashboard Features
The dashboard includes interactive filters for date, country, age bracket, and product. It uses map visuals for regional sales analysis, bar and line charts for sales and product trends, detailed customer-level tables, and KPI cards for quick performance monitoring.

## Tools and Technologies Used
Power BI was used for data visualization and reporting. DAX was used for calculated measures and KPIs. Data modeling and data cleaning techniques were applied to prepare the dataset for analysis.

## Project Value
This project demonstrates the complete data analytics workflow, from raw data to actionable insights. It highlights strong Power BI dashboarding and DAX skills and is suitable for Data Analyst, Business Analyst, and Power BI Developer roles.
